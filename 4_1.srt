{1|for as long as humans have been building civilizations}
{2|we've been reliant on one very special ecosystem from Egypt to China to}
{3|Mesopotamia many of our most ancient cities depended on the river ecosystem}
{4|for food water and transportation even now in modern times}
{5|rivers are among the most economically and ecologically important ecosystems}
{6|around welcome back explorers in this special}
{7|two-part adventure we'll be learning all about the river ecosystem including what}
{8|characteristics to find these places what organisms we can find here and why}
{9|they matter to you and me in this first part we'll be looking at River structure}
{10|information and in the second part we'll be looking at River food chains these}
{11|are some of my absolute favorite places to go exploring so let's jump right in}
{12|and learn about the river ecosystem even the largest rivers start with a network}
{13|of smaller Springs streams and creeks called tributaries which eventually}
{14|connect to create one large flow many of these smaller tributaries are like mini}
{15|rivers of their own and are much easier to study in film we'll be using this}
{16|tributary of the ad controller to learn about the abiotic or nonliving}
{17|components of the river ecosystem to start with it's important that we know}
{18|how rivers are defined for one thing rivers contain flowing water in usually}
{19|lots of it most rivers have a clearly defined}
{20|channel where the water flows as well as river banks which are dry areas of land}
{21|on either side of the channel the actual course of the river may change over time}
{22|but these two key components are nearly always present both provide important}
{23|habitat for many plants and animals as the water that makes up rivers and their}
{24|tributaries flows across the landscape it picks up components of the}
{25|terrestrial ecosystems that it passes through this means that rivers often}
{26|contain a wide variety of soils minerals nutrients and organic matter from many}
{27|different locations these new materials being added to}
{28|rivers can be a very important part of their ecology ensuring that there's}
{29|enough nutrients to support the complex food chains which we find here however}
{30|this also means that any pollutants or silts can get into the water from}
{31|surrounding areas and contaminate the entire ecosystem pollutants can include}
{32|toxins such as arsenic or lead which are dangerous for both aquatic organisms and}
{33|humans or silts which cloud up the water and block sunlight from reaching the}
{34|organisms living in it we call the process by which water picks up and}
{35|moves materials erosion we can clearly see erosion when walk at places on the}
{36|riverbank like this where it looks like the loggers cutting into the ground now}
{37|over long periods of time erosion is the process that creates huge geological}
{38|features such as canyons deposition is when materials that have been picked up}
{39|by the water are then placed somewhere else usually when the water slows down}
{40|we can see an example of deposited materials right here where the water has}
{41|slowed down and left lots of sand behind both erosion and deposition are}
{42|processes that have huge impacts on how River ecosystems look and how the}
{43|organisms in them live they can also have serious consequences on human}
{44|behavior because who wants to build a house somewhere that is being eroded}
{45|away by a river that's one of the reasons that we are constantly tracking}
{46|where water is flowing in what impact it is having on the land around it}
{47|every drop of water that falls from the sky as precipitation will eventually}
{48|make its way to a river by tracking where the water in a certain area ends}
{49|up we can map out an area call the watershed all the water in this location}
{50|will find its way to a specific River and eventually the ocean understanding}
{51|watersheds is very important because if we don't know where the water in a river}
{52|is coming from we have no idea where pollutants or new species can be coming}
{53|from watersheds are usually huge covering hundreds of miles of land}
{54|that means that our river systems are taking in huge amounts of material as}
{55|they flow throughout the landscape even if a piece of trash isn't directly}
{56|dumped in a river by me or you it still ends up there either during a rainfall}
{57|event or by getting washed into a tributary the study of water and how it}
{58|moves is known as hydrology and is just as important as ecological studies when}
{59|dealing with a river ecosystem if you don't understand how rivers form and}
{60|what makes them unique it is difficult to understand why the organisms found}
{61|within these systems look in act the way they do the most important things to}
{62|remember from today's episode or that rivers are areas of moving water with a}
{63|clearly defined channel and stream banks in that they contain pieces of all the}
{64|terrestrial ecosystems around them and the second part of this video we'll be}
{65|taking a look at River food chains a meeting so with incredible plants and}
{66|animals that we can find here until then stay curious and keep adventuring}
{67|everywhere this is Benzino of the wild report signing out}
