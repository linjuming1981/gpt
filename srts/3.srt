1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:07,600
a Sinister laugh pierces The Silence of the African Savannah soon joined by the

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:15,240
sounds of Flesh tearing and Bones being pulverized haunting arched back

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,920
creatures Dart around their meal ripping it apart with their enormous Jaws in

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:29,000
just 25 minutes an entire zebra is devoured skin Hooves bones teeth and all

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,399
only a pool of blood Remains the spotted hyena is the most

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,600
numerous large predator in Africa with an estimated 27,000 to 47,000

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,239
individuals living in the wild their habitat includes all types of

8
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,640
environments such as forests swamps mountains and deserts and their

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,760
reputation among humans wherever they may be is largely negative they're often

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,879
seen as ugly cowardly and gluttonous the evil cronies who helped scar kill

11
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,119
Mufasa the Shady llies who lurk in the shadows waiting for an opportunity to

12
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:14,400
steal a more noble animals meal their cackling is unsettling and their large

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,360
teeth punched over figure and darting movements are menacing but hyenas are so

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,360
much more than just creepy they are remarkably intelligent and extremely

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,640
effective Hunters largely because they don't operate

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,439
alone they live in clans of six to over 100 individuals larger than any Wolfpack

17
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,000
lion pride or orcapod and these groupings aren't just a bunch of

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,439
individuals who happen to coexist near each other these Clans are incredibly

19
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,280
sophisticated and their social structure is unlike that of any other carnivore

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,960
but sophisticated doesn't mean Pleasant the lives of spotted hyenas are filled

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,320
with brutal and constant competition with other members of their Clan to even

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,200
get a chance at eating a meal a spotted hyena must prove its dominance over the

23
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,560
others again and again and for the males this is even more difficult because

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,920
females always dominate them and while a matriarchal group of animals is not

25
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,519
unheard of it gets even weirder female hyenas are not just in charge they've

26
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:33,040
also evolved so that their genitals look almost exactly like male genitalia they

27
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,120
urinate mate and even give birth through this pseudo penis why do hyenas live in

28
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,280
such big groups when these groups are filled with constant fighting why are

29
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,360
the females in charge and why did their reproductive organs evolve to be

30
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,840
indistinguishable from a

31
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:06,159
males of the four species of hyena the spotted or laughing hyena is the largest

32
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,840
and while most people compare hyenas to dogs they actually have more in common

33
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,400
genetically with cats and are even more closely related to mongooses and civits

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,840
and the size of a spotted hyena might surprise you they are not the scraggly

35
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,040
little muts Disney makes them out to be they're actually as large or larger than

36
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:35,920
wolves weighing up to 86 kg or 190 lb and reaching 1.8 m in length and for its

37
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,319
size the spotted hyena has one of the strongest skulls of any carnivore hyid

38
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,360
are the only existing animal who evolved to crack bones with their jaws and

39
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,560
spotted hyenas are the top among them their bite can exert a pressure of 80 kg

40
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:01,280
Force per square cm or 1,140 PSI which is 40% more Force than a

41
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,480
lion can generate and 15% more than a grizzly bear wild hyenas have even been

42
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:14,720
seen cracking open giraffe femur which measure 7 cm in diameter the teeth of a

43
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,199
spotted hyena are built exactly for this the upper and lower third Prem molers

44
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:26,360
are enormous conical bone Crushers compare this to an African lion it's a

45
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,000
voracious Predator but does not have the bone crushing molers that a hyena does

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,720
in addition to this the spotted hyena has a pronounced sagittal Crest to which

47
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,800
extremely strong jaw muscles are attached this bone cracking ability

48
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,320
allows them to take advantage of a food source that is inaccessible to most

49
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,639
animals but they weren't always so formidable before the spotted hyena

50
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,639
diverged from the striped and brown hyenas 10 million years ago its direct

51
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,039
ancestor would have been a smaller scavenger type hyena that could maybe

52
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,919
Crush some bones but not take down massive prey but at one point in their

53
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,320
evolution spotted hyenas developed sharp caracals behind their crushing premolar

54
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,919
teeth that cut through tough skin like scissors these teeth becoming bigger and

55
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,120
sharper meant the hyenas no longer had to wait for their prey to die to eat it

56
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,400
as is the case with solitary scavengers like the brown hyena they had evolved to

57
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,520
become social Hunters unlike other types of hyenas spotted hyenas kill about 95%

58
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,759
of their food themselves scientists have ranked their hunting abilities on par

59
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,160
with that of lions and cheetahs their large bodies likely evolved as a result

60
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,039
of the transition from Scavenging to hunting scavenger hyenas tend to be

61
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,080
smaller to use less energy while covering great distances in order to

62
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,000
find a meal whereas social Hunters need to be bigger to take down large prey but

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,599
that's not to say hyenas can't travel great distances and travel fast they

64
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,800
extra long front legs let them run at speeds up to 60

65
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,560
kmph chasing down prey for sometimes kilomet at a time the size of their prey

66
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,120
depends on if they're hunting alone or in a group while solo they'll go after

67
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,319
smaller animals like birds rabbits porcupines and fish as their numbers

68
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,000
grow they choose bigger and bigger pre from gazel and warthogs to Buffalo and

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,440
even young rhinos once they catch their meal spotted hyenas give out their

70
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,080
characteristic laugh to alert their Clan and the feasting begins within minutes

71
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,759
entire animals are consumed and although they are primarily Hunters hyenas don't

72
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,280
discriminate when it comes to their food source they've been seen eating bugs

73
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,919
like termites and caterpillars and also rotting putrid flesh that other animals

74
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,199
refuse to eat and yet they don't even get sick from it they happily eat

75
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,960
Anthrax infected carcasses and are unaffected by infectious disease

76
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,240
outbreaks like rabies and distemper which have killed many lions and wild

77
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,000
dogs one way they fight off these potentially deadly microbes is by having

78
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,440
an incredibly acidic stomach herbivores who don't eat risky meat have a stomach

79
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,639
pH of 4 to 6 many carnivores who try to stick to fresh meat have a stomach pH of

80
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:37,879
3.6 and a hyena stomach pH is less than two this High concentration of

81
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,280
hydrochloric acid decimates most bacteria before it can do any damage

82
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,800
hyenas also have a relatively short digestive tract which prevents bacteria

83
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,400
from lingering too long hyenas also likely pass small doses of pathogens

84
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,840
around as they groom eat and compete with each other which may help build up

85
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,520
group-wide immunity to toxins like Anthrax and on top of this they have

86
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,639
naturally high levels of antibodies but not all spotted hyenas

87
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,680
have the same amount the higher the social status a spotted hyena has the

88
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,879
more antibodies they carry such hyenas are better fed and spend less energy on

89
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:26,400
hunting and nursing injuries lower ranked hyenas do not get such luxuries

90
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,360
and it's not just antibody levels that are at stake when it comes to the social

91
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,320
order of hyenas in a hyena Clan everything comes down to

92
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,919
rank spotted hyena Clans have the most rigid hierarchy structure of any social

93
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,839
mammal and it really pays to be on top in addition to Better Health a higher

94
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:56,279
rank means more food stronger allies and the right to reproduce and in a clan of

95
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:02,600
spotted hyenas females are always in charge physically female spotted hyenas

96
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:09,600
are larger than males by as much as 20 kg they're also stronger and arguably

97
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,760
meaner at the top of the group is the alpha female when she has Cubs they're

98
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,320
ranked right beneath her and as they grow up their cubs are ranked beneath

99
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,760
them and so on daughters usually remain in their birth Clan For Life and build

100
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,600
close relationships with their mothers and sisters one grouping of of mothers

101
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,279
and daughters is known as a matrilineal group separate matrilineal groups often

102
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,200
join together creating one massive Clan these kin groups are organized within

103
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,480
the clan by the dominance level of their oldest female but unfortunately for

104
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,279
males their place is always at the bottom the life of a male hyena may

105
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,079
start out okay if he's born to a high ranking female but this is shortlived

106
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:03,640
males are only allowed to stay with their families for around 2 to 3 years

107
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,279
after that they leave the clan they're born into and beg for admittance into a

108
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:14,640
new one if accepted they will rank absolute last after all females and

109
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,680
their cubs and after other males who joined the clan before them they are

110
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,079
known as immigrant males and their life basically sucks they're forced to live

111
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,600
on the outskirts are the last to eat if there's even anything left

112
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,040
and have absolutely no say in when or with who they get to mate they are

113
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,600
generally riddled with injuries have worn down teeth from chewing on too many

114
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,880
bones and live half as long as females while the life of a female isn't nearly

115
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,560
as Bleak it's endlessly competitive while males are known appeasers during

116
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,880
conflict to avoid losing what little status they have females are much more

117
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,480
aggressive and are constantly picking fights to gain or keep their rank Clans

118
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,320
are usually stable for many years but if any of the top ranking females die peace

119
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,959
is no longer guaranteed a coalition of the lower ranking females May topple the

120
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:19,680
alpha female Coalition from the throne females will even kill each other's Cubs

121
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,680
to maintain their social standing and to cut their Rivals Bloodlines short in one

122
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,000
study that looked at deaths of cubs under Oney old 21 out of 99 of them

123
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,160
could be attributed to infanticide Always by female Killers many times the

124
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,360
killer was even related to the Cubs she murdered even litter mates have to

125
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,160
compete sometimes to the death most litters have two Cubs which fight for

126
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,560
the right to nurse first Sometimes one Cub will end up killing their weaker

127
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,920
sibling half of young hyenas die before reaching maturity so why do hyenas

128
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,680
bother living together if there's so much risk because whether they like it

129
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,279
or not they need each other because while the risk from hyenas within their

130
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,240
own Clan is high the risk from other clans of hyenas or Prides of lions is

131
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,800
even higher they need each other to defend themselves and their kills and to

132
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,320
take down large prey and those immigrant males who all the females seem to hate

133
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,040
they too are recruited to help with hunting or fighting and these hyena

134
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,600
Clans however dysfunctional are extremely effective they've been

135
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,040
observed defending territories of up to 620 square mil or, 1600 square km from

136
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,040
outside threats a single hyena could not defeat a lion but a clan of hyenas

137
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,880
absolutely can hyenas are the only thing lions are regularly seen running from

138
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,880
but as soon as the prey is killed or outside threat is nullified hyenas

139
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,920
within the same Clan do try to keep their distance from one another to

140
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,240
reduce the chances of Confrontation this Arrangement is known

141
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,560
as a fishion fusion Society individuals come together when needed and then

142
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,680
disperse as soon as possible and maintaining this Arrangement requires

143
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,040
sophisticated communication skills spotted hyenas have one of the richest

144
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,079
vocal repertoar of any terrestrial mammal their laugh sounds Sinister but

145
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,600
is actually a sign of excitement fear or frustration and their whooping call

146
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,279
conveys a wealth of information to their clanmates it's a haunting sound that can

147
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:47,880
travel up to 3 miles transporting with it information about the color including

148
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,600
its identity sex and age hyenas can even count how many calls they are hearing a

149
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,360
useful tool when trying to gauge whether to fight a rival gang

150
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,600
hyenas live and die by the clan a clan ruled by females a clan whose

151
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,440
cooperation breeds competition but there's one more thing about spotted

152
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,480
hyenas that's just downright strange the reproductive organs of a female spotted

153
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:24,560
hyena look almost exactly like a male's and scientists don't really know

154
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:32,959
why the reproductive organs of female spotted hyenas are unlike any other

155
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,199
animal even other hyena species they have an unusually long clitoris

156
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:45,759
resembling a penis it's been classified as a pseudo penis or peniform clitoris

157
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,680
and is used to urinate mate and give birth they also have a fused and

158
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,399
enlarged labia resembling a scrotum this atypical Anatomy has caused researchers

159
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,880
to misgender female spotted hyenas as male only to discover the truth when

160
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,800
they've later given birth this unusual Anatomy means they're the only mammal to

161
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,839
lack a vaginal opening which makes mating and birthing very difficult to

162
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:22,079
mate a female retracts the pseudo penis in on itself kind of like pushing up the

163
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,000
sleeve on your shirt and creates an opening into which the male inserts his

164
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,560
own penis and while this may be difficult there's one benefit that's

165
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,759
clear it gives the female hyenas complete control over who they mate with

166
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:41,639
because penetration is impossible without their cooperation but even when

167
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,199
mating does occur the chances of successful reproduction is low Hyena's

168
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,639
reproductive Canal is twice as long as a similarly sized animals and includes a

169
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,600
hair pin turn making it an incredible difficult Journey for sperm traveling to

170
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,680
the uterus and and for Cubs during birth for first time mothers living in

171
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,319
captivity about 60% of their cubs die most often from Suffocation while

172
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,680
getting stuck in the birth canal these challenges have made scientists wonder

173
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,040
why spotted highas have evolved in this way since reproduction is essential for

174
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,440
survival of the species why has their Anatomy developed in such a way that

175
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,920
makes it so difficult it all comes back to competition there their large skulls

176
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,160
jaws and teeth are what makes spotted hyenas able to crush bones which lets

177
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,920
them outperform other Predators but growing these features takes several

178
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,639
years so in order for young hyenas to survive long enough to develop them

179
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,079
hyena mothers nurse their cubs for around 14 months and help them get

180
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:54,079
enough food even after they're weaned until they're three or four this means

181
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,279
it's in the interest of the species for birth rates to be lower than other types

182
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:03,279
of Predator why extra babies have to die in the birth canal or fight each other

183
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,559
to the death instead of simply not being conceived in the first place I don't

184
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:14,559
know the theme of hyena life seems to be brutality at every turn but as ruthless

185
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,480
as it all seems so much of what hyenas are fighting for is to keep their cubs

186
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,439
alive hyenas are very caring mothers when their cubs die they are distraught

187
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,440
and they do everything in their power to protect them and keep them safe the

188
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,480
reputation of hyenas as creepy selfish scavengers is largely misplaced while

189
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,880
their lives are Rife with hardship and competition their capacity for

190
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,919
cooperation is unrivaled in the world of predators and their place among the

191
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,559
predators of Africa is not lowly behind the Cheetahs leopards and lions if

192
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:57,200
anything clans of hyenas are the top among them all no one knows spotted

193
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,240
hyenas better than the people who study them in the field and of them no one is

194
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,679
more well-versed than expert biologist and animal behaviorist K whole Camp I

195
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,799
was lucky enough to snag an interview with her to get the inside story about

196
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,799
what it's like to study these amazing creatures in the wild and our main

197
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,440
research tools are a pair of binoculars and a notebook we can watch them from

198
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,000
about this far away it's just a blast being in the field with spotted hyenas

199
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,720
for so long Dr Hull Camp has seen a huge array of personalties ities and it's

200
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,640
impossible to not form attachments to certain individuals my favorite hyena of

201
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,600
all time was a hyena named cois and she was really curious a very smart hyena

202
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,440
and she figured out that she could go catch a gazelle and she could do it in

203
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,840
the presence of all these other hyenas and then she would bring it right over

204
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,080
and put it right down next to the tire but nobody else would come that close to

205
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,720
the car and she figured this out right away but life in the bush is dangerous

206
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,039
you know she I saw her get bitten in the face by a big Cobra once he had two

207
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,559
puncture wounds on either side of her nose nose and they started welling up

208
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,240
blood and I thought oh no you know she's going to die now and she staggered off

209
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,320
into the bushes and I didn't ever expect to see her again but a couple days later

210
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,679
she comes out of their bushes and she's looking just fine so her stories about

211
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,200
how these animals defy death at every turn are incredible and she explains

212
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,799
what humans stand to learn from their near invincibility but working in the

213
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:26,440
field is no Cakewalk either and hearing her stories about the dangers she and

214
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,080
her team face spending months the field in Kenya are riveting and most of all I

215
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,679
love doing interviews like this to learn what it's actually like to do the

216
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,159
research that I talk about here on YouTube for everyone who dreams of one

217
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,799
day being a biologist interviews like these with Dr hul Camp shine a light on

218
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,880
the wild adventure that such a career entails to watch the full unedited

219
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,520
interview head over to nebula and find it under the real science field notes

220
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,640
page nebula is a streaming platform that we built for exactly this reason to

221
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,320
explore topics more deeply sometimes in new formats like this interview nebula

222
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,600
allows me to take risks like this and experiment more whether it's this

223
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,200
extended interview or the nebula original series I made called becoming

224
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,640
human about the incredible story of how we came to understand human evolution

225
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,559
nebula is a place for all of its creators to make experimental and new

226
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,840
content like Joe Scott's Mysteries of the human body which takes you through
