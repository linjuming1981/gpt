00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,760
[Music] why is it so hard

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,960
for people to understand this really basic concept

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,840
if you want to win and you want to guarantee that you are going to get

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,639
where you want to get

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,520
everybody wants to guarantee that's why they ask so many questions you know they

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,640
say how long is it going to take what's the best way to get here what's

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,640
this what's that and they analyze all these different things

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,920
and they try to come up with this college auditorium size blackboard full

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,559
of formulas and graphs and all these things that are going to make

10
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,920
us more successful they're going to get us the respect that

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,760
we're looking for the recognition that we look for

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,039
we try to plan all of these things out and the problem is for most people as

13
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,290
they come to a point where they are overwhelmed by the information

14
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,960
[Music] and every once in a while you've just

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,200
got a bottom line what's the bottom line here

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,439
and the bottom line for you and the bottom line for me and the bottom line

17
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,200
for every other on this planet is really simple

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,080
if you want to be great if you want to get the recognition if you want to get

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,479
paid if you want all of the things that you dream about there is

20
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,119
only one way to guarantee that you will have those things only one

21
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,200
and that is becoming so good at what you do no matter what it is you do

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,720
that is undeniable that other people recognize how great you are

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,200
it's a character trait that you develop that means any place that you

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,119
are put you will put in the work you will learn the skills you will improve

25
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,159
your arsenal to become

26
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,799
the undeniable best in that role and if you have that attitude

27
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,719
you are going to be the absolute best that you can be

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,479
if you remember this concept and put it in play

29
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,570
you cannot ever lose

30
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,879
[Music] it doesn't matter where you come from it

31
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,040
doesn't matter what your background is it doesn't matter what race you are what

32
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,959
gender you are it doesn't matter who your parents are

33
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,599
dude we can make every excuse in the book

34
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,840
but i promise you for every excuse you can make there are

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,920
literally thousands of people who had it harder than you that have

36
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,280
done what the you want to do there is nothing that can stop you

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,599
when you become so skilled that every single person around you sees that and

38
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,200
it recognizes that and that is a habit

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,959
that is not a gift that is something that you can create

40
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,560
it's a skill you can learn so develop the skill of becoming undeniable if you

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:09,159
remember this concept and put it in play you cannot ever lose

42
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,829
