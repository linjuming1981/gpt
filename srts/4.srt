1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,510
for as long as humans have been building civilizations

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,510
we've been reliant on one very special ecosystem from Egypt to China to

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,610
Mesopotamia many of our most ancient cities depended on the river ecosystem

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,800
for food water and transportation even now in modern times

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,510
rivers are among the most economically and ecologically important ecosystems

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,529
around welcome back explorers in this special

7
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,390
two-part adventure we'll be learning all about the river ecosystem including what

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,950
characteristics to find these places what organisms we can find here and why

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,510
they matter to you and me in this first part we'll be looking at River structure

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,309
information and in the second part we'll be looking at River food chains these

11
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,480
are some of my absolute favorite places to go exploring so let's jump right in

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,730
and learn about the river ecosystem even the largest rivers start with a network

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,039
of smaller Springs streams and creeks called tributaries which eventually

14
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,770
connect to create one large flow many of these smaller tributaries are like mini

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,020
rivers of their own and are much easier to study in film we'll be using this

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,330
tributary of the ad controller to learn about the abiotic or nonliving

17
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:23,400
components of the river ecosystem to start with it's important that we know

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,220
how rivers are defined for one thing rivers contain flowing water in usually

19
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,119
lots of it most rivers have a clearly defined

20
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,790
channel where the water flows as well as river banks which are dry areas of land

21
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,970
on either side of the channel the actual course of the river may change over time

22
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:50,250
but these two key components are nearly always present both provide important

23
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,159
habitat for many plants and animals as the water that makes up rivers and their

24
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,479
tributaries flows across the landscape it picks up components of the

25
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,369
terrestrial ecosystems that it passes through this means that rivers often

26
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,770
contain a wide variety of soils minerals nutrients and organic matter from many

27
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,849
different locations these new materials being added to

28
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:19,020
rivers can be a very important part of their ecology ensuring that there's

29
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,580
enough nutrients to support the complex food chains which we find here however

30
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,200
this also means that any pollutants or silts can get into the water from

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,420
surrounding areas and contaminate the entire ecosystem pollutants can include

32
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,459
toxins such as arsenic or lead which are dangerous for both aquatic organisms and

33
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,230
humans or silts which cloud up the water and block sunlight from reaching the

34
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,720
organisms living in it we call the process by which water picks up and

35
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,470
moves materials erosion we can clearly see erosion when walk at places on the

36
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,850
riverbank like this where it looks like the loggers cutting into the ground now

37
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,260
over long periods of time erosion is the process that creates huge geological

38
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,959
features such as canyons deposition is when materials that have been picked up

39
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,190
by the water are then placed somewhere else usually when the water slows down

40
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,620
we can see an example of deposited materials right here where the water has

41
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:26,250
slowed down and left lots of sand behind both erosion and deposition are

42
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,500
processes that have huge impacts on how River ecosystems look and how the

43
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,269
organisms in them live they can also have serious consequences on human

44
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:39,959
behavior because who wants to build a house somewhere that is being eroded

45
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,640
away by a river that's one of the reasons that we are constantly tracking

46
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,700
where water is flowing in what impact it is having on the land around it

47
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,109
every drop of water that falls from the sky as precipitation will eventually

48
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:59,910
make its way to a river by tracking where the water in a certain area ends

49
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,400
up we can map out an area call the watershed all the water in this location

50
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,980
will find its way to a specific River and eventually the ocean understanding

51
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,120
watersheds is very important because if we don't know where the water in a river

52
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,590
is coming from we have no idea where pollutants or new species can be coming

53
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:25,620
from watersheds are usually huge covering hundreds of miles of land

54
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,120
that means that our river systems are taking in huge amounts of material as

55
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,500
they flow throughout the landscape even if a piece of trash isn't directly

56
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,030
dumped in a river by me or you it still ends up there either during a rainfall

57
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,830
event or by getting washed into a tributary the study of water and how it

58
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,470
moves is known as hydrology and is just as important as ecological studies when

59
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,750
dealing with a river ecosystem if you don't understand how rivers form and

60
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,460
what makes them unique it is difficult to understand why the organisms found

61
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:05,520
within these systems look in act the way they do the most important things to

62
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,320
remember from today's episode or that rivers are areas of moving water with a

63
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,060
clearly defined channel and stream banks in that they contain pieces of all the

64
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,860
terrestrial ecosystems around them and the second part of this video we'll be

65
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,639
taking a look at River food chains a meeting so with incredible plants and

66
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,990
animals that we can find here until then stay curious and keep adventuring

67
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:34,130
everywhere this is Benzino of the wild report signing out
